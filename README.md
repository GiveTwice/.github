# ❤️ GiveTwice

**Wishlists that give back.**

GiveTwice is an open-source wishlist app where all affiliate revenue goes to charity. Create and share your wishlists, and when friends buy gifts through our links, the commission helps those in need.

## What we're building

- Simple, beautiful wishlists you can share with anyone
- Affiliate links that generate donations automatically
- Privacy-first: your data stays yours
- Multi-language support (EN, NL, FR and growing)

## Tech stack

Built with Laravel, Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, and lots of love.

## Contributing

We'd love your help! This project is in its early days, so there's plenty of room to shape things.

Whether it's code, design ideas, translations, or just feedback — all contributions are welcome. Check out the issues, open a PR, or just say hi.

## Early days

GiveTwice is brand new. Things might be rough around the edges, features are still being built, and we're learning as we go. That's part of the fun!

If you believe in gifting that gives back, come build it with us.
